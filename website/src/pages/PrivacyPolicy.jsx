                        children under the age of 13. If an individual is under
                        the age of 13, they should not use our services or
                        otherwise provide us with any personal data either
                        directly or by other means. If a child under the age of
                        13 has provided personal data to us, we encourage the
                        child’s parent or guardian to contact us to request that
                        we remove the personal data from our systems. If we
                        learn that any personal data we collect has been
                        provided by a child under the age of 13, we will
                        promptly delete that personal data.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Security of Personal Data</h2>
                    <p>
                        We have implemented reasonable physical, technical, and
                        organizational safeguards that are designed to protect
                        your personal data. However, despite these controls, we
                        cannot completely ensure or warrant the security of your
                        personal data.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Retention of Personal Data</h2>
                    <p>
                        We will usually retain the personal data we collect
                        about you for no longer than reasonably necessary to
                        fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, and in
                        accordance with our legitimate business interests and
                        applicable law. However, if necessary, we may retain
                        personal data for longer periods of time as required
                        under applicable law or as needed to resolve disputes or
                        protect our legal rights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To determine the appropriate duration of the retention
                        of personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
                        sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of
                        harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal
                        data and if we can attain our objectives by other means,
                        as well as our legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, and
                        other applicable obligations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once retention of the personal data is no longer
                        reasonably necessary for the purposes outlined above, we
                        will either delete or deidentify the personal data or,
                        if that is not possible (for example, because personal
                        data has been stored in backup archives), we will
                        securely store the personal data and isolate it from
                        further active processing until deletion or
                        deidentification is possible.

                        Since we do not collect personal data that identifies
                        you when you access our websites or use our Platform, we
                        may not have any way to identify if we only collect
                        automatic data alone. Before processing your request to
                        exercise certain rights (including the Right to Know,
                        Access & Portability, Correction, and Deletion), we will
                        need to verify your identity and confirm you are a
                        resident of a state that offers the requested right(s).
                        In order to verify your identity, we will generally
                        either require the matching of sufficient information
                        you provide us to the information we maintain about you
                        in our systems. As a result, we require requests
                        submitted through our online form to include first and
                        last name, state of residency and/or the date of your
                        last transaction with us.

                    <p>
                        In certain circumstances, we may decline or limit your
                        request, particularly where we are unable to verify your
                        identity or locate your information in our systems, or
                        where you are not a resident of one of the eligible
                        states.

                    <p>
                        In certain circumstances, you are permitted to use an
                        authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf
                        through the designated methods set forth above where we
                        can verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on
                        your behalf. In order to verify the authorized agent’s
                        authority, we generally require evidence of either (i) a
                        valid power of attorney or (ii) a signed letter
                        containing your name and contact information, the name
                        and contact information of the authorized agent, and a
                        statement of authorization for the request. Depending on
                        the evidence provided and your state of residency, we
                        may still need to separately reach out to you to confirm
                        the authorized agent has permission to act on your
                        behalf and to verify your identity in connection with
                        the request.

                        your minor child in accordance with applicable law, you
                        must provide sufficient information to allow us to
                        reasonably verify your child is the person about whom we
                        collected personal data and you are authorized to submit
                        the request on your child’s behalf.

                <h3>Purposes and Legal Bases of Processing</h3>
                <p>
                    When we process your personal data, we will do so in
                    reliance on the following lawful bases:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Contract:</strong> Where the processing is
                        necessary for the performance of a contract to which you
                        are a party, or to take steps at your request prior to
                        entering into a contract with you. This applies to any
                        processing where you sign a contract with us, for
                        example when you become our customer or deliver services
                        to us as a vendor or contractor. This may also include
                        processing necessary for the performance of our Terms of
                        Use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Legitimate Interest:</strong> Where the
                        processing is necessary for the purposes of a legitimate
                        interest that are not overridden by your interests or
                        fundamental rights and freedoms (e.g., to provide,
                        maintain, and improve our products and services, conduct
                        data analytics, and communicate with you regarding our
                        services).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Vital Interest:</strong> Where the processing is
                        necessary to protect the vital interests of you or
                        another person (e.g., to protect your physical safety).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Public Interest:</strong> Where the processing
                        is necessary to perform tasks carried out in the public
                        interest or in the exercise of official authority vested
                        in us (e.g., to cooperate in an ongoing law enforcement
                        investigation).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Legal Obligation:</strong> Where the processing
                        is necessary to comply with our legal obligations (e.g.,
                        to maintain a record of your personal data to comply
                        with laws and regulations related to bookkeeping,
                        accounting, taxation, and employment).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Consent:</strong> Where we have your consent for
                        the processing (e.g., when you opt in to receive
                        marketing communications from us). When consent is the
                        legal basis for our processing of your personal data,
                        you may withdraw your consent at any time.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You are not required to provide personal data to us, but we
                    do rely on your personal data to provide certain of our
                    products and services. For example, we need your personal
                    data to facilitate and deliver an order that you request. If
                    you choose not to provide us with your personal data, we may
                    not be able to provide you with a service or product you
                    request. We will inform you at the point that we collect
                    personal data from you if the provision of certain personal
                    data is mandatory or optional for receipt of our products
                    and services.

                <h3>Automated Decision-Making and Profiling</h3>
                <p>
                    We do not conduct automated processing of personal data,
                    including profiling, for the purposes of making decisions
                    about you.
                </p>

                <h3>Retention of Personal Data</h3>
                <p>
                    We will usually retain the personal data we collect about
                    you for no longer than reasonably necessary to fulfill the
                    purposes for which it was collected, and in accordance with
                    our legitimate business interests and applicable law.
                    However, if necessary, we may retain personal data for
                    longer periods of time as required under applicable law or
                    as needed to resolve disputes or protect our legal rights.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The criteria used to determine the period of time for which
                    personal data about you will be retained varies depending on
                    the legal basis under which we process your personal data:

                        <strong>Contract:</strong> Where we are processing
                        personal data based on contract, we generally will
                        retain the information for the duration of the contract
                        plus some additional limited period of time that is

                        interest, taking into account the fundamental interests

                        represents any applicable statute of limitations for

                        public interest / official authority, taking into
                        account any obligations we may have to retain the

                        generally will retain the information for the period of
                        time necessary to fulfill the legal obligation plus some
                        additional limited period of time that represents the
                        statute of limitations for legal claims that could arise
                        from the legal obligation.

                        retain the information for the period of time necessary
                        to fulfill the purposes for which you have provided your
                        consent.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    In certain circumstances, we may need to apply a “legal
                    hold” that retains information beyond our typical retention
                    period where we face threat of legal claim. In that case, we
                    will retain the information until the hold is removed, which
                    typically means the claim or threat of claim has been
                    resolved. In all cases, in addition to the purposes and
                    legal bases identified above, we consider the amount, nature
                    and sensitivity of personal data, as well as the potential
                    risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of personal
                    data, in determining the relevant retention period. Once
                    retention of the personal data is no longer reasonably
                    necessary for the purposes outlined above, we will either
                    delete or deidentify the personal data or, if that is not
                    possible (for example, because personal data has been stored
                    in backup archives), we will securely store the personal
                    data and isolate it from further active processing until
                    deletion or deidentification is possible.

                <h3>International Transfers of Personal Data</h3>
                <p>
                    We may operate and engage third-party partners and providers
                    in various jurisdictions. Therefore, we and our third-party
                    providers may transfer personal data to, or store, access,
                    or process personal data in, a country other than the one in
                    which it was collected, including, but not limited to, the
                    United States. The country to which personal data is
                    transferred may not provide the same level of protection for
                    personal data as the country from which it was transferred.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may transfer personal data about you outside of the EEA,
                    UK, and Switzerland, and when we do so we rely on
                    appropriate or suitable safeguards recognized under
                    applicable law, including adequacy decisions and standard
                    contractual clauses. If you would like more information on
                    the specific safeguards we use (and obtain a copy of such
                    safeguards, where applicable), please contact us at{" "}

                <h4>Adequacy Decisions</h4>
                <p>
                    We may transfer personal data about you to countries that
                    the relevant regulatory authority has deemed to adequately
                    safeguard personal data, either automatically or in
                    connection with a specific safe harbor framework.
                </p>

                <h4>Standard Contractual Clauses</h4>
                <p>
                    Certain regulatory authorities have adopted standard
                    contractual clauses, which provide safeguards for personal
                    data transferred outside of the originating jurisdiction. We
                    may use these standard contractual clauses when transferring
                    personal data to a third country that has not been deemed to
                    adequately safeguard personal data.

                    (taking into account the confidential nature of any personal
                    data we maintain), we will need to verify your identity and
                    confirm you are accessing our services or otherwise
                    interacting with us from the EEA, UK, or Switzerland. In
